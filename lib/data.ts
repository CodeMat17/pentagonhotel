  { category: "Location", question: "Is airport pickup available?", answer: "Yes — ₦25,000 each way in a saloon car, more for an SUV. Give us your flight number and we track it, so a delayed landing doesn't mean a missed driver." },
  { category: "Location", question: "How close is the University of Port Harcourt?", answer: "The Choba campus main gate is 1.2km — a five-minute drive or a fifteen-minute walk. We are the closest full-service hotel to the campus." },

      "Start on our side of the water. Choba Market opens early and is at its best before the heat sets in — go for the pepper and the fabric, stay for the noise. It is a seven-minute drive from the hotel, or a twenty-minute walk if you are the walking type and it is not raining.",
      "By late morning, head into the GRA. The restaurant strip there is where the city eats when it wants to be seen eating, and it is worth one meal of your two days. Give yourself thirty minutes each way and do not book anything tight on either side.",
      "Afternoon belongs to the Pleasure Park if you have children with you, or to a long lunch if you do not. Evening, come back to this side. The Fifth Bar catches the breeze from about six, and on the last Friday of the month there is live highlife until late.",
      "Day two: if you have business at Onne, leave by 6:30am. If you do not, spend the morning at the pool and the afternoon at Isaac Boro Park. Fly out from Omagwa allowing a clear ninety minutes from our door — thirty-five on a good day, but the road does not always have good days.",

      "Three years ago, an organiser running a two-hundred-delegate event in Rivers State booked into the GRA by default and moved everybody by bus. That has quietly stopped being the obvious choice.",
      "The first reason is UNIPORT. Academic conferences want to be near the campus, and Choba is the campus. Delegates walk in. Speakers do not lose an hour each way. When the schedule slips — and it always slips — nobody misses their session because of the East-West Road.",
      "The second is Onne. The free zone brings a steady flow of corporate events that need to be reachable from both the port and the airport, and Choba sits between them rather than beyond one of them.",
      "The third is more prosaic: dedicated entrances. The Pentagon Hall has its own door and its own lobby, which means a conference registration desk never queues behind hotel check-in at 2pm. Organisers notice this exactly once — the first time they run an event somewhere that doesn't have it.",
      "None of this makes Choba the right answer for every event. If your delegates are all flying in for a single day, the airport side still wins. But for anything that runs more than a day, or anything with a university in it, the maths has changed.",

      "There is a moment, near the end of a pot of jollof, where the rice at the bottom starts to catch. Most kitchens treat that as a failure. We treat it as the point.",
      "The base is unremarkable and deliberately so: blended red pepper, tomato, onion, a long reduction until the raw edge goes and the colour deepens to something closer to brick than red. Rice goes in, stock goes in, lid goes on, and then nobody touches it.",
      "The last four minutes happen over charcoal, not gas. The pot sits directly on the coals and the bottom layer takes on a smoke that you cannot fake with liquid smoke, paprika or good intentions. Then the whole pot is turned once, so the smoked layer folds through the rest.",
      "That is the entire trick. It is not a secret, it is just inconvenient — it requires charcoal in a professional kitchen, which most hotels have quietly stopped keeping. We have not, and we do not intend to.",

      "The generator is sized for full house load, not partial. That distinction matters at 2pm in March when every room is occupied and every air conditioner is running. A generator sized for 60% of load works beautifully in the dry season and fails in exactly the week you need it.",
      "We also run the fibre line on the protected circuit rather than on the general one, which is why the Wi-Fi survives what the street outside does not. It is a small engineering decision that shows up in about a third of our reviews.",
